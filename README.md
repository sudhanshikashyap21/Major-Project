WEB DEVELOPMENT MAJOR PROJECT

Title - E-commerce Website

• An e-commerce site is a website where users buy products through an online platform. • Amazon, eBay, and any online retail store fit under this category. • E-commerce websites actually require quite a bit of back-end development. • For example, managing shopping carts throughout a visitor’s duration on the site (and oftentimes after) utilizes an impressive amount of data manipulation. • But front-end development is paramount as well. You need front-end development to display goods in a way that attracts customers and to ensure the site is easily navigable.
